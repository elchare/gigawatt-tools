# gigawatt-tools

## Background.

Gigawatt (https://www.giga-watt.com) is a mining hosting service. To track the earnings and fees, they provide a CSV file. 
However, this file cannot be easily visualized, analyzed, or imported to other tools. Thus, in its current format, it has limited 
usability.

## Short-term objective. 

To have a code that can parse the CSV file generated by Gigawatt and transform it into a format that can be 
easily used and imported to other tools. For example, Microsoft Excel and Cointracking.info.

## What functionality does the code provide?

Tool 1: Transforms the Gigawatt CSV file into a regular CSV (see the file CSVConverter.java). The output can be opened in Microsoft Excel.

Tool 2: Transforms the Gigawatt CSV file into a CSV file that can be imported to Cointracking.info (see the file CointrackingConverter.java).

## How do I get access to the tools?

You have two options:

a) Pull the code and compile it yourself.

b) Download the pre-compiled tools from the folder [tools](https://github.com/elchare/gigawatt-tools/tree/master/tools)

## How do I use the tools?

For all the details, please see the documentation that I added to the code. 

For a graphical user interface, double click on the file [tool-gui.jar](https://github.com/elchare/gigawatt-tools/raw/master/tools/tool-gui.jar)

For a command line intercae, you can use any of the following syntaxes:

$ java -jar <tool_name> inputFile.csv ouputFile.csv

$ java -jar <tool_name> inputFile.csv > outputFile.csv

$ java -jar <tool_name> < inputFile.csv > outputFile.csv

Just replace <tool_name> with the jar file of the tool that you want to use ([tool1.jar](https://github.com/elchare/gigawatt-tools/raw/master/tools/tool1.jar) or [tool2.jar](https://github.com/elchare/gigawatt-tools/raw/master/tools/tool2.jar)).

## How are the timezones handled?

The timezone in the Gigawatt CSV is in UTC. Tool 1 does not modify the data. Tool 2 transforms the time read from the Gigawatt CSV to
the local timezone of your system. If you want a different timezone, feel free to change the code yourself, or send me a message.

## I found a bug, can you fix it?

Yes, I can (just not immediately, but as soon as I can). Just send me a message. I do not work for Gigawatt.

## I found the tools to be useful. I would like to donate.
